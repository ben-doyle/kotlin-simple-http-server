# SimpleHTTPServer-kotlin

An excersize to better learn the ins and outs of a HTTP request, I am working on a basic HTTP server written in kotlin
using only in build Java and Kotlin libraries.

Using the following references:
- [Java 8 documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/)
- [RFC2616 for HTTP 1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616)
